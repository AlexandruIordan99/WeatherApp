Initial project made to familiriase myself with Java and because I was always annoyed by Dutch weather. The app uses OpenMeteo's Weather and Geolocation APIs to get weather information about any location in the world. The frontend uses Swing to display that information, namely degrees, the chance of rain, wind speed, wind direction and wind pressure.
